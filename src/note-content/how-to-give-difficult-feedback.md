contentTitle: How to give difficult feedback
---

Employees who get feedback regularly do better[^1]. And yet, giving constructive feedback, either during coaching or evaluation feedback (todo link to types of feedback), is one of the most difficult parts of a manager's job[^2].

Of course, the most important enabler when giving difficult feedback is having a strong, trusted relationship with the person receiving feedback. I have described mechanisms that help build a relationship like this here (link to the three types of feedback) and here (link to feedback environment).

But, regardless of the strength of your relationship, the way in which you give the feedback matters. The following is a set of strategies I have collected from books and podcasts. I have seen all these work well in practice (often when I was receiving feedback, rather than giving it).

## Listen first

If you google "How to give difficult feedback", you get inundated with a [slew](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-give-negative-feedback-properly-2275334) [of](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2018/08/31/how-to-give-negative-feedback-more-effectively/) [articles](https://www.caba.org.uk/help-and-guides/information/how-give-difficult-feedback-work) from "coaching institutes" that tell you everything you need to _say_.

Concentrating on what to say will quickly get you tangled up in misunderstandings. The best feedback starts with listening[^3]. As feedback giver, you typically have a very one-sided view of the problem. Before you're in a position to say anything, you should try and see the world through the eyes of the person receiving feedback. The best way to do this is to get the receiver to talk through their experience.

A fellow manager related an experience where he softly berated a fellow employee who wasn't making much progress on a task. It eventually turned out the employee had de-prioritised the work in response to some urgent request from another part of the organisation. This changes the tenet of the feedback from "why isn't this done?" to "how can you prioritise better and keep stakeholders informed?".

I have found the following open-ended questions effective at starting a conversation:
- when giving feedback on a piece of work that didn't meet the expected standard: "how do you think this went?", "how could we make this better?", or "what skill or support would have helped?"
- when asking about slow progress: "what are your priorities?", "how does this task fit into your priorities?", "what do you think is the deadline for this?"
- with interpersonal issues: "how do you think that meeting went?", "how is your interaction with X?"

## Make it feel like you are siding with the receiver against the problem

It is easy to make giving feedback feel very transactional: "when you missed this deadline, it hurt our relationship with this customer." Many [frameworks](https://medium.com/pm101/the-situation-behavior-impact-feedback-framework-e20ce52c9357#:~:text=SBI%20stands%20for%20the%20Situation,%2C%20and%20action%2Doriented%20feedback.&text=To%20finalize%20it%2C%20you'll,the%20impact%20of%20their%20actions.) recommended for giving feedback encourage exactly that kind of conversation. This typically leads to very accusatory discussions where the receiver feels at fault, and attacked personally.

Instead, use language that shows that you and the receiver are on the same side, attacking a problem together[^6]. For instance, you could say: "When we missed that deadline, it risked losing that customer. What can we do to avoid this? How can we prioritise effectively? What additional support could I have given?". By using "we", you take joint ownership of the problem[^4], rather than rejecting the blame on the receiver.

## Beware the stories you tell yourself

Giving difficult feedback is hard. We therefore tend to ruminate for days (or sometimes weeks) before giving it. This leaves plenty of time for our brain to take the facts and weave them into a rich narrative: "Bob missed this deadline because he doesn't understand the importance of customer relationships. He just thinks about technology." ... and suddenly, you're giving Bob feedback on the importance of customer centricity, rather than asking about the deadline[^7]. And Bob is going to be so confused. To make things worse, these narratives often fall prey to [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error).

These narratives are never helpful. To break their hold, I have found it useful to prepare for the feedback session by writing down facts, so I have them to hand. Then, listening during the meeting helps make sure I can see the world from the point of view of the receiver, rather than from the midst of the narratives I have built around the problem.

## Beware sugarcoating feedback

There is evidence that [managers sugarcoat feedback unintentionally](https://hbr.org/2019/10/are-you-sugarcoating-your-feedback-without-realizing-it). The worse the feedback, the more they sugarcoat it. And, worse, they don't realise they've made the situation sound less bad that it is. This happens because giving negative feedback is stressful, leaving little headspace for the feedback giver to really pay attention to how their words might get misinterpreted.

In evaluation feedback (todo link to types of feedback), this can lead to serious performance concerns being mis-interpreted as mild preferences of the feedback giver.

The good news is that just being aware of this helps mitigate the effect. A good tactic to check the receiver has understood the importance and content of the feedback is to check for their understanding by asking them to summarise the conversation, or asking them to come up with a plan to course correct that you can review together.

## A little, often

Like many things we don't like, we tend to put giving difficult feedback off until the last possible moment. But putting off giving feedback increases the [difficulty super-linearly](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html). It's much easier to give low-key feedback often than to bottle it up.

Besides breaking the feedback down into manageable pieces, giving feedback often helps build trust with the receiver, and helps you practice delivery.

For most knowledge workers, organisations are a wicked learning environment (todo link). It can be very hard to see the consequences of one's actions. In turn, this makes it hard to grow. Offering regular feedback is one of the most impactful way to help your coworkers progress. I hope some of the tactics in this note make giving feedback feel more manageable.
