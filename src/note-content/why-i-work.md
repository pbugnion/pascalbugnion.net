I get tremendous enjoyment out of my work at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai)<Sidenote>The idea of reflecting on what I get out of work comes from reading Ray Dalio's [Principles](https://www.principles.com/).</Sidenote>. Most of this enjoyment comes from fulfilling two needs:

- I need to build things. I get positive [feelings of craftsmanship](./editor-hacking) and pride from seeing things grow and develop. This isn't limited to software (I used to love woodwork at school), but there's no other craft with the same iteration speed as building digital products. I suspect this sense of craftsmanship is shared by many engineers and designers<Sidenote>For instance, this is evident in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). One of the principles states "_Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility._"</Sidenote>. I still get the same pleasure now that I am in more of a technical lead role, and thus less viscerally connected to the construction process. It's less immediate, but equally fulfilling.

- I need to share the process of building things with thoughtful, open-minded colleagues that share the same goals. One of my great joys at work is collaborating on designing a feature or solving a problem with other people, getting to a solution together, and then seeing that built. In this sense, I see work as predominantly social: the pleasure I get is from having positive social interactions. The work itself guarantees alignment and [trust](/notes/what-is-trust): I know the people I collaborate with share the same goals as me. It also provides an endless source of topics to collaborate on.

As I moved from an individual contributor into a more managerial role, I did more of the latter and less of the former, but my enjoyment remained the same.

Of course, there are lots of other positive externalities: by building things and building relationships around building things, I inevitably get better at both, so I feel like I'm learning continuously. Obviously, that's important to me too. But when I've learnt something, I get far more pleasure if I can see how it'll fix an impediment to what I'm currently building, and if I can share that with other people in the team.
