I get tremendous enjoyment out of my work at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai)<Sidenote>The idea of reflecting on what I get out of work comes from reading Ray Dalio's [Principles](https://www.principles.com/).</Sidenote>. Most of this enjoyment comes from fulfilling two needs.

## I need to build things...

I get positive [feelings of craftsmanship](/notes/editor-hacking) and pride from imagining something and then bringing it to life. This need to build things predates my interest in software. As a child, I spent days building gigantic castles in Lego. This transitioned into building wood furniture when I became too old for Lego to be socially acceptable. When I discovered programming and, eventually, software, at university, I was set: same positive vibes as woodwork, but less immediate risk I'll cut my fingers off. There's no other craft with the same iteration speed and potential impact as [building digital products](/code)<Sidenote>I suspect this sense of craftsmanship is shared by many engineers and designers. For instance, this is evident in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). One of the principles states "_Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility._"</Sidenote>.

I still get the same pleasure now that I am in more of a technical lead role, and thus less viscerally connected to the construction process. It's less immediate, but equally fulfilling.

## Building things is more fun when shared

While building things by myself is fun, it's so much better when I can share the process of building things with thoughtful, open-minded colleagues that share the same goals. One of my great joys at work is collaborating on designing a feature or on solving a problem, getting to a solution together, and then building that solution together. I see work as predominantly social: the pleasure I get is from having positive social interactions and feeling part of a group. The work itself guarantees alignment and [trust](/notes/what-is-trust): I know the people I collaborate with share the same goals as me. It also provides an endless source of topics to collaborate on.

As I moved from an individual contributor into a more managerial role, I did more of the latter and less of the former, but my enjoyment remained the same.

Of course, there are lots of other positive externalities: by building things and building relationships around building things, I inevitably get better at both, so I feel like I'm learning continuously. Obviously, that's important to me too. But when I've learnt something, I get far more pleasure if I can see how it'll fix an impediment to what I'm currently building, and if I can share that with other people in the team.
