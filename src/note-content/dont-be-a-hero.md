contentTitle: Don't be a hero
---

My team is a platform team. It provides tools and services to other teams in the organisation. One of our responsibilities is helping data scientists use the tools we provide.

When I was an individual contributor, I spent a lot of time helping other people use the tools we provide. I was good at it. People were thankful, so I got a lot of recognition. It felt good.

Now that I am in a people lead position, that's no longer my remit. In most day-to-day situations, I have been able to hand this responsbility over (link to delegating when it gets hard). But sometimes, it's challenging.

We recently had an emergency that required a lot of context and quick action. I naturally fell back into old patterns. I felt like I didn't have time to delegate, and thought I could protect the team by just dealing with the problem myself. I fixed the problem. People were very thankful. My name was called out in our company's all hands. I got more credit than I deserved.

Stepping back into an old role was a mistake. It was disempowering to people in the team, who should have been given the opportunity to shine, to be the hero. By solving them problem myself, I deprived them of that opportunity and of that recognition.

So, future me, don't be a hero. That's not your job. Your job is to enable the rest of the team to be heroes (link to benefits of delegating).
