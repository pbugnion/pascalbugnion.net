Employees who get more feedback (link to three types of feedback) perform better [^1]. Employees normally welcome feedback because it reduces uncertainty and can help them improve. But they are often reluctant to actually ask for feedback because:
1. asking for feedback leads to vulnerability (the employee might look bad, or the feedback might hurt the employee's ego) [^2]
2. they worry the feedback giver will say no, either because they are busy, or because they don't like giving feedback [^3].

How can we remove these barriers to encourage employees to get more feedback from their team leads, from other managers, and from each other?

## Show you're available to give feedback

One of the reasons employees don't ask for feedback from their managers is because they either think the manager is too busy, or that they don't want to give feedback.

To change this, you can emphasize the importance of feedback, in, for instance, team meetings. I remember, for instance, our CTO encouraging us to watch [Kim Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Tcr0T9Tyw) on "radical candor".
You can show that you're available by welcoming feedback requests and by responding quickly.

To make giving feedback a stronger part of the team culture, you can assign mentors to every employee, so they have a named person they can turn to who can give them feedback, or through whom they can channel feedback requests (todo link to types of feedback). We have now been doing this for four years in [Faculty](https://faculty.ai). It has been broadly successful at both increasing the amount of feedback people get, and the quality of that feedback.

## Reduce the risk of ego damage when delivering feedback

When asking for feedback, the employee puts themselves in a position of vulnerability. They risk damaging their ego or their self-esteem. Some of the feedback conversations that have helped me improve the most were conversations that I was dreading ahead of time.

The vulnerability associated with requesting and receiving feedback never goes away. However, by building a relationship of trust with the feedback giver (link to trust), it is more likely that the employee will overcome their reluctance and actually request feedback. Trust can develop more easily between a designated mentor and an employee if that mentor isn't also responsible for performance assessments (link to coach and judge).

Empowered employees -- employees who believe in the impact of their work and their ability to achieve it -- are also more likely to seek feedback because they have greater self-confidence[^4]. You can increase their sense of empowerment both by helping them understand how their work fits into the organisation's strategy, and by making sure they feel supported in their work (link to delegating benefits).

Finally, when actually delivering feedback, there are useful tactics (todo link to how to give difficult feedback) the giver can use to avoid making it look like they are attacking the receiver.
