"Deliberate practice" is in vogue [^1]. The only thing standing between you and greatness is, apparently, several thousand hours of practice. Just look at Ben Hogan, a golfer who spent hours practicing his swing and eventually became really good[^2]. I love turnkey recipes for greatness as much as anyone, so I'm sold. 

Unfortunately, these articles promising greatness are less clear on how to apply this to the real world. How do I practice deliberately? In particular, how do I use this to become a better leader?

And that's the sticking point. Unlike golf, there's no obvious practice that will make me a better leader.

## Wicked and kind learning environments

The difference between golf and people leadership is the type of feedback you get on your actions. Behavioural scientists Robin Hogarth and Emre Soyer identify two archetypical learning environments [^3]:
- In a **kind** learning environment, like golf or chess, you get immediate, clear feedback on your actions. A golf swing is clearly good or bad, depending on how close to the hole it gets you.
- In a **wicked** learning environment, like most knowledge work, feedback is delayed or filtered such that it can be hard to attribute a particular outcome to an action.

This isn't binary. For instance, programming is fairly kind: how a system scales with users, for instance, can be traced back to specific decisions, but you might not know straightaway.

Deliberate practice works best in kind learning environments: I can take an action, see the result, and gradually repeat until I have the desired result.

## People leadership is a wicked environment

People leadership is a wicked learning environment, for two reasons:
- **it's unclear what good looks like**: we typically recognize a manager as good by the outcomes she gets: typically, if her team is happy and delivers, we will think of her as a good manager. Of course, there are [leading indicators](https://pascalbugnion.net/blog/making-yourself-useful-as-a-middle-manager), such as being able to clearly articulate a vision, or [taking the time to listen](https://pascalbugnion.net/blog/slack-makes-better-leaders), but assessing these is subjective.
- **long feedback loops**: There are typically long feedback loops between a particular action and its result. A particular outcome (e.g. an employee leaving) will be the result of many little actions over several months, making it hard to know what to do differently, or what to learn from the process. I feel this painfully in the retrospectives we organise following a negative event (e.g. a customer churning). These rarely lead to concrete, actionable learnings, because lots of 

## So how do we learn?

So if deliberate practice only works in kinder learning environments, what's an aspiring people leader to do?

There are two complementary tactics that work well to create a kinder environment:
- Shortening feedback loops by showing work in progress, by soliciting feedback, by building a culture where openly disucssing ideas is encouraged, and by learning to assess your own performance.
- Carving out kind learning environments for specific skills. For instance, in his blog, Mike Crittenden writes that he intends to work on his public speaking to become a better manager[^4]. Practicing public speaking is a kinder environment, since it has clearer feedback loops.
