contentTitle: How dissent leads to better performing teams
slug: /notes/importance-of-dissent

The word _team_ brings up images of harmony, of saccharine smiles, of vigorous agreement, and of people striving towards a common goal in concert.

Humans like harmony. We dislike strife and conflict. In particular, we dislike being the only person to speak out in defence of an idea against prevailing consensus[^1]. It feels deeply uncomfortable.

In a team context, this means that, when we know there is a majority consensus on a topic, we feel under pressure to conform to the majority. In fact, we may not even realise we are conforming: there is evidence that just knowing there is a majority opinion in favour of an argument encourages us to selectively read and seek information that confirms the opinion of the majority[^2], and to solve problems in the same way as the majority[^3].

In a group, this drives discussions towards premature convergence. The group spends less time looking broadly for information and trying different approaches to solve a problem. This reduces the amount of divergent thinking, which is key to making good decisions.

In contrast, having people speak out against the majority consensus demonstrably improves decision making, _even when the people speaking out are wrong_! Having a minority of dissenters that speak out against the majority forces the entire group to consider more evidence (often, the majority does this in order to convince the minority). In a work context, there is plenty of evidence that more minority dissent leads to more divergent thinking, and leads to better performance[^4] and more innovation[^5].

Thus, to help our teams make better decisions, we, as team leads, can help create an atmosphere where people feel comfortable dissenting.

The effect of minority dissent on decision making is discussed in depth in Charlan Nemeth's book _In defense of troublemakers_.

[^1]: The most striking evidence comes from the famous [Asch conformity experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asch_conformity_experiments) that demonstrates that people are surprisingly bad at even very simple tasks if they are misled by a majority.
[^2]: For instance, in a study at UC Berkeley, students were told they were being interviewed about proposed changes to campus housing policy. Proposals included imposing gender segregation of floors, a policy that was known to be widely unpopular. In the first phase, test subjects were shown made-up survey results that suggested 80% of their peers supported the proposal. Students were then made to wait for the next phase and, while waiting, could consult material either in favour or against the proposed changes. Students in the control troup -- who hadn't seen the fake survey result -- spent as much time looking through articles that supported and opposed the proposal. In contrast, students who had seen the survey result and thus believed there was broad support for the proposal spent ??% of their time looking through articles that supported the majority opinion.

[^3]: For instance, in a study, test subjects were shown a sequence of five letters written like `rTAPe`. They were told to write the first three letter word they saw. Students almost always wrote `tap`, unsurprisingly. Students in the test group were then given made-up feedback that most other participants had found `pat` -- the first string of capital letters you see when reading from right-to-left. The exercise was repeated with a ten-letter string. Students in the control group, who hadn't seen the made-up feedback, continued to find words by reading left-to-right, unsurprisingly. Students in the test group predominantly searched for words by reading from right to left, and found fewer words as a result!
