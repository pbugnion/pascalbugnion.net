contentTitle: How organisations indoctrinate members
slug: /note/organisation-expressing-uncertainty

Members of an organisation normally express greater confidence in the organisation's direction of travel than an outsider with the same information would. Said another way, organisations are very vulnerable to some amount of groupthink.

In the extreme case, this results in cults: followers have blind confidence in the cult, whereas outsiders are very skeptical. But even in more rational organisations, like a typical workplace, members will express more confidence in the organisation's direction of travel than what can be rationally justified.

## Why does this happen?

This overconfidence occurs because, at all levels, members of the organisation are incentivised to communicate with greater certainty than they feel. Leaders need to communicate a vision to the organisation to help give members a sense of purpose. Expressing vision clearly while leaving sufficient space for nuance or uncertainty is challenging. This encourages leaders to speak with more confidence than they genuinely feel. IC's are then discouraged to speak out, both because speaking out against the majority opinion is hard[^2], but also because the illusion of certainty discourages even questioning the vision[^3]. Most people find uncertainty destabilizing, so sinking into a false sense of comfort is easy, and people who question that sense of comfort are violently challenged.

Taken together, leadership's need to communicate vision clearly and IC's pressure to conform lead to the average member of the organisation feeling more confident in the direction of travel than might be justified by evidence.

## Is this so bad?

A clear, unequivocal vision allows an organisation to execute on that vision. It allows most members to concentrate on realising the vision day-to-day while feeling certain that their work is impactful. If the vision is even directionally right, going full speed in that direction is better than the stasis engendered by analysis paralysis.

The danger comes when the company leadership succumbs to this groupthink, and starts believing that the approval of the rest of the organisation is a reliable indicator of the quality of the strategy. The leadership is responsible for continuously reassessing whether the strategy merits tweaking (or throwing out). To do this without falling prey to this groupthink requires seeking input from external advisors, identifying and measuring objective metrics of success (e.g. is my product selling?), and fostering a culture of dissent among at least a portion of the employees. The most egregious failures[^3] occur when company leadership starts believing in the infallibility of its strategy.

[^1]: There is plenty of evidence in the psychology literature that suggests people make poor decisions just to follow the majority. The most famous example is the [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments): test subjects were very strongly influenced by the majority which, unbeknownst to the subject, was made up entirely of confederates of the experimenter. The influence was sufficiently strong that test subjects often trusted the majority over their own eyes.
[^2]: Even knowing there is a majority consensus around an issue encourages seeing the world from the point of view of the majority. We selectively seek opinion that confirms the consensus, instead of opting for a broad search. This is described in chapter 4 of ‘In Defense of Troublemakers: The Power of Dissent in Life and Business: Amazon.Co.Uk: Nemeth, Charlan Jeanne: 9780465096299: Books’.
[^3]: As [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) sank into increasingly dubious accounting practices, employees rallied around the leadership. When the CEO verbally attacked an analyst who complained that Enron was the only company not to release balance sheets, [most employees sided with the CEO](https://www.webcitation.org/5tZ2MXiZi?url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/ceo-anger-management-ceonetwork-leadership-outbursts_slide_2.html), whereas the rest of the financial community sided with the analyst. Less egregiously, there is evidence that the collapse of [Swissair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissair) was caused by significant groupthink within the board. This groupthink led the Swissair board to double down on decisions most airline industry analysts thought were bad, such as investing money in the loss-making Sabena. This is described in Hermann, Aaron, and Hussain Rammal. ‘The Grounding of the “Flying Bank”’. Management Decision 48 (3 August 2010): 1048–62. https://doi.org/10.1108/00251741011068761.
