contentTitle: People who write about leadership are rarely leaders themselves
---

Most people who write about management or leadership are not leaders. In fact, the main activity of most people who write about management is to write about management[^1].

This happens for two reasons: 
1. people who offer coaching services to managers or leaders are incentivized to write a lot to come across as experts.
2. team leaders write infrequently both because there is little incentive to do so[^2], and because writing about leadership or management is hard: most people learn to lead through intuition (link to management wicked learning environment), so distilling it into blog posts or a book can be challenging.

Essays about leadership from people who are not leaders should be treated with caution. The advice they develop is divorced from the reality of leading a team[^3]: they either rehash well-known bromides or make claims that they are not able to test. While this happens in many fields, it is specially pernicious in an area like people leadership, which does not stand on a firm theoretical foundation.

The word of people with significant experience in leadership should therefore be rated highly. Everyone else's is of little value. I have found the following blogs by practicing people leaders insightful:

[^1]: If you need any evidence of this, Google "how to be a better manager", and watch as stock images of smiling men wearing suits roll down your screen.
[^2]: In fact, people in leadership positions are more likely to write about a domain they are an expert in, rather than leadership. Many of my colleagues in leadership positions at [Faculty](https://faculty.ai) maintain blogs about [maths](https://tcbegley.com/blog) or [software](https://acroz.dev/) or [design](https://www.instagram.com/zerotodesign/), but rarely about management or leadership.
[^3]:  Andy Matsuchak writes about a similar problem facing tool-makers [here](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3H98n8DGZmu8XArqHZVsckyWvbTe8wK4kAt2): people who use tools are rarely the same people as the ones who make them. Tool makers therefore lack the experience of using the tool in their day-to-day life.
