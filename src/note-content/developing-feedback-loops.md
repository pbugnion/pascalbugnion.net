contentTitle: Developing feedback loops as a people leader

Management is a wicked learning environment (todo link). Learning mechanisms, like deliberate practice, are ineffective. It can be very hard to draw concrete conclusions from specific events. For instance, why did Rob leave? Is it because I mis-managed that conversation? Probably, but there were other factors. This tangled web of cause and effect makes it hard to improve.

One of the most effective ways to improve as a people leader is to shorten and clarify feedback loops: the quicker I get feedback on an action, the clearer the lesson I can draw from it, and the more I can learn. Lest you think I'm just making things up, this is backed up by evidence from social psychology literature: knowledge workers who explicitly seek feedback perform better [^1].

How can we explicitly build rapid feedback loops?

## Feedback on behaviour

Having a small number of trusted people whom I trust to call me out when I'm messing up is probably the most valuable feedback loop. Good candidates are:
- people I work closely with so they have enough context to provide high-quality feedback
- people who are invested in helping me succeed: typically my manager or close peers

Developing relationships to the point that people feel comfortable giving you brutally honnest feedback is hard work. I have found it useful to gradually build trust first (todo link to abi). Once there is enough trust, I give feedback to the person, thus putting myself in a position of vulnerability. Only then do I explicitly solicit feedback.

[This post](https://smallbigideas.substack.com/p/own-your-feedback-part-1) by Padmini Pyapali has great ideas on how to elicit feedback.

## Feedback on ideas

One of the best ways to develop good ideas, and learn how to present them, is to show work in progress early. I have found that discussing half-formed ideas in one-on-ones forces peers to engage and think critically through the idea. This results in you and the peer gradually iterating on the idea and improving it.

Venkatesh Rao describes this as [executive sparring](https://artofgig.substack.com/p/introduction-to-executive-sparring).

## Creating a culture of dissent

So far, we have only talked about feedback given in 1 on 1 interactions. While this type of feedback tends to be the highest quality, it also suffers from bias: you are only getting feedback from a subset of people.

Having a team that is empowered to tell you if you are screwing up is one of the most valuable feedback loops. Explicitly encouraging and supporting people who disagree with you, or with the majority, in group settings, is one of the best ways to create a high-performing team. Doing this well is a topic for another post, but the most important factor is recognising that it takes courage for someone to dissent publicly against a team lead, or the majority. The best you can do as a leader is to engage meaningfully with people who disagree with you.

## Nurture feedback

Getting feedback on leadership qualities is uncomfortable: unlike code reviews, feedback on leadership feels more personal. It hits closer to home. This means we're more likely to avoid seeking it. However, since leadership skills are so hard to practice, or to learn from books, developing good feedback channels is key to gradually improving as a people leader.
