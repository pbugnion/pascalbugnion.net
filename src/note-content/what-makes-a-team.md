Most of us intuitively understand the idea of a team. The word brings up mental images of harmony, together-ness, maybe even motivational posters with people holding hands. Bleugh. 

How is a team different to a group of people collaborating on a task?

The team I work with is a part of my identity: I say "I work on the Faculty Platform team", and I feel a sense of pride akin to someone saying they support Manchester United. It also offers a sense of belonging: the team provides a social safe space. Belonging to a high-functioning team is probably one of the main drivers of people's happiness at work.

A sense of team grows from two mutually reinforcing concepts:
- Interdependence: the work of the team requires contributions from multiple team members
- shared accountability: team members feel responsible for all of the team's output, not what they themselves produce

Interdependence and shared accountability work together. Tasks that require team members to work together encourage shared accountability, and shared accountability encourages the team to take on tasks in an increasingly integrated way, with more people contributing. Over time, if things go well, this leads to a virtuous cycle where the team keeps improving.

## Psychological safety as the basis for shared accountability

Shared accountability allows team members to collaborate without keeping score. This collaboration allows the team to work together as more than the sum of its parts.

Getting to shared accountability requires that team members be comfortable putting themselves in a position of relative vulnerability: a junior engineer needs to be comfortable asking for help from a more senior team member, team members need to be comfortable expressing ideas and taking interpersonal risks.

To be comfortable with this vulnerability, team members have to trust (todo link to trust) each other. They have to trust that they can ask for help without judgement, that they express ideas without risking ridicule. Once they start doing this, and there are positive social consequences, it becomes self-reinforcing: they are more willing to show vulnerability, which leads to better results, increasing the sense of trust.

## Making a team

To help transform a group of people into a team, we, as team leads, need to encourage both interdependence and shared accountability. To encourage team members to work together, we can help them find tasks that require collaboration from several team members. Then, when working together, we can help create an atmosphere of psychological safety that allows interpersonal trust to develop.
